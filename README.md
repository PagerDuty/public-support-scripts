# PagerDuty Public Support Scripts

This is a collection of miscellaneous scripts that the PagerDuty Support Team
has written and collected over time. Their purpose is to perform specific,
limited-scope tasks through the REST API that cannot (as of the time that they
are written) be performed through the PagerDuty UI.

This README shall serve as both a set of instructions on the usage of these
scripts as well as a description of how this repository is to be maintained and
organized.

## Contents

* [Import users](import_users)
* [Maintenance window bulk operations](maintenance_windows_bulk_operations):
  schedule series of recurring maintenance windows, and bulk-delete future
  maintenance windows.
* [Mass update incidents](mass_update_incidents): Update or resolve many
  incidents in an automated fashion
* [Notifications team report](notifications_team_report): Generate a report of
  notification counts scoped to one or more specific teams
* [Overrides bulk operations](overrides_bulk_operations): Schedule vacation
  overrides for a given user, list overrides, or mass-delete a list of
  overrides.
* [Remove SMS contact methods](remove_sms_contact_methods): Delete SMS-type
  contact methods and notification rules for all users in a PagerDuty account
* [Update user emails](update_user_emails): perform account-wide modifications
  to login email addresses of users based on search and replace patterns,
  including with with regular expressions
* [De-provision users](user_deprovision): Automate the off-boarding process for
  PagerDuty users by removing them from schedules and escalation policies, and
  resolving all incidents that they are assigned.

## Howto

Each of the directories within this repository describes a task in `snake_case`
carried out by the script(s).

In each of these directories shall be the script(s) that carry out the task, plus
documentation on usage.

Each script can be run as a standalone program, i.e.:
```
./name-of-script.lang <options>
``` 

As opposed to requring it to be run as follows, although it is also an option:

```
<interpreter> name-of-script.lang <options>
```

If including the command line flag `-h`, the script shall print out
instructions for usage ("helptext").

The directory shall also contain a file `README.md` containing any additional
usage instructions that cannot be included in the helptext and/or historical
information about the origin of the script (i.e. original author/source) and
how it has been used / can be used.

## Installing Dependencies

In some cases, scripts will require additional software modules or libraries in
order to run.

### Python Scripts

If the script is written in Python, the directory shall include a file
`requirements.txt`, which can be used to install dependencies with `pip` as
follows:

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

The program [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) must be installed
in the local operating system in order to perform this type of dependency
installation.

More information on requirements files can be found in the pip documentation, at
[pip.pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files).

### Ruby Scripts

If the script is written in Ruby, the directory shall include a file `Gemfile`
specifiying gem dependencies, that can be used to install them using the
`bundle` command.

[Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) will need to installed in the
local operating system in order to perform this type of dependency
installation.

More information on gemfiles and Bundle can be found here:
[bundler.io/gemfile.html](https://bundler.io/gemfile.html)

## Contributing

In addition to following each of the above conventions, i.e. residing in its
own directory, each script shall begin with with a "shebang" line as follows:

```
#!/usr/bin/env <interpreter>
```

Where `<interpreter>` is the language command (i.e. `ruby`, `python`, `perl`
etc.). Specific versions of interpreters (i.e. Python 2.7 or Python 3) shall be
specified in the name of the exectuable. If the generic name is used (i.e.
`python`), the script should be written such that it is compatible with the
widest possible range of versions that might be available on any given
operating system.

## External Scripts

The following is a list of supplemental scripts that may eventually be merged
into this collection and standardized/documented in the future according to the
outlined above. Any that remain referenced here indefinitely have been deemed
sufficiently well-documented and self-contained, i.e.:

- They reside in their own GitHub repository (which facilitates contributing to
  them) versus a Gist or a file in itself passed around
- They already follow many of the conventions of this collection of scripts
- The original maintainer is willing to review and accept pull requests to fix
  bugs
- They are both hosted and used externally / in the cloud, i.e. JSFiddle
