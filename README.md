# PagerDuty Public Support Scripts #

These scripts are helpful tools the PagerDuty Support Team has collected. These scripts can be used to perform a variety of useful tasks, including:

- Importing users from CSV
- Downloading alerts to a CSV
- Creating vacation overrides
- Getting recent user activity

These scripts have been migrated to the PagerDuty REST API v2. Documentation on this version of the API is available [here](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs). The versions of these scripts that utilize v1 of the REST API are available [here](https://gist.github.com/lfepp/120a020e057f959a0032e5b719593cdb).

Most scripts have been updated to accept command-line arguments as opposed to hard-coded values. Executing these scripts without any arguments will print the usage information.
