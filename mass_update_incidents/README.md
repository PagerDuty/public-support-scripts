# Mass Update Incidents

Performs status updates (acknowledge or resolve) in bulk to an almost arbitrary
number (maximum: 10k at a time) of incidents that all have an assignee user or
service (or both) in commmon.

If operating on more than 10k incidents: it is recommended that you run the
script several times by constraining it to a service ID each time, and/or
requesting a time range by setting the `-d/--date-range` option.

## Script Arguments

Below are the arguments for the script.

`-d` : Only act on incidents within a date range. Must be a pair of ISO8601-formatted time stamps, separated by a comma, representing the beginning (since) and end (until) of the date range. By default, incidents of all time will be updated.

`-k` : REST API key. Follow this [guide](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys) if you need to know how to generate a new API key.

`-n` : Do not perform the actions but show what will happen.

`-s` : ID of the service, or comma-separated list of services, for which incidents should be updated; leave blank to match all services.

`-u` : ID of user, or comma-separated list of users, whose assigned incidents should be included in the action. Leave blank to match incidents for all users.

`-a` : default=`resolve`, Action to take on incidents (acknowledge/resolve)

`-e` : Email address of the user who will be marked as performing the actions.

## Examples

The below example will only dry run the script and no actions will be taken to resolve/acknowledge the incidents.

```
python3 mass_update_incidents.py -k API-KEY_HERE -u USER-ID -a acknowledge -e YOUR-EMAIL -n
```
The below example will acknowledge all the incidents assigned to a user.

```
python3 mass_update_incidents.py -k API-KEY_HERE -u USER-ID -a acknowledge -e YOUR-EMAIL
```

The below example will resolve all incidents that belongs to a service.

```
python3 mass_update_incidents.py -k API-KEY_HERE -s SERVICE-ID -a resolve -e YOUR-EMAIL
```

The below example will resolve all incidents assigned to both user1 and user2.

```
python3 mass_update_incidents.py -k API-KEY_HERE -s USER1-ID,USER2_ID -a resolve -e YOUR-EMAIL
```
